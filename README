3rd party XMonad extensions and contributions.

Build and install through Cabal as for other Haskell packages:

        runhaskell Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME
        runhaskell Setup build
        runhaskell Setup install --user

(You may want to remove the --user flag when installing as root.)

scripts/ contains further external programs useful with xmonad.

Haskell code contributed to this repo should live under the
appropriate subdivision of the 'XMonad.' namespace (currently includes
Actions, Config, Hooks, Layout, Prompt, and Util). For example, to use
the Mosaic layout, one would import:

 XMonad.Layout.Mosaic
